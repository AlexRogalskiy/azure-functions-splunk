# Azure Functions for Splunk

This repository contains available [Azure Functions]( https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/functions/) to integrate Microsoft data with Splunk.  Azure Functions can be triggered by certain events like an event arriving on an Event Hub, a blob written to a storage account, a Microsoft Teams call concluding, etc.  The functions in this repository respond to these events and route data to Splunk accordingly.

## Getting Started

Each available set of functions in this repository is contained within its own folder.  For example, the Microsoft Graph functions are contained in the graph folder.  To deploy the functions to your Azure environment, click the Deploy to Azure button located in the README.md in the corresponding function folder.

## Available Functions

| Functions | Location | Description |
